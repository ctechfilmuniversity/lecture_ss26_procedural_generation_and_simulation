* What is a tiling?

A tiling is a flat surface with some pattern of geometric shapes (*tiles*), with no overlaps or gaps.

So far, we have used simple grids to create repetitive patterns. However, grid with hexagons are also very commonly used!

* Advantage of hex maps in games: consistent distance from center to center compared to squares.
* This distance is √3 times that of a hexagon side.

he primary advantage of a hex map over a traditional square grid map is that the distance between the center of each and every pair of adjacent hex cells (or hex) is the same. By comparison, in a square grid map, the distance from the center of each square cell to the center of the four diagonal adjacent cells it shares a corner with is √2 times that of the distance to the center of the four adjacent cells it shares an edge with. This equidistant property of all adjacent hexes is desirable for games in which the measurement of movement is a factor. The other advantage is the fact that neighbouring cells always share edges; there are no two cells with contact at only a point.

The fixed shape of the water molecule means they can assume a stable crystal arrangement only when arranged as a 6-branched figure. Despite essential hexagonal similarity no two snowflakes are identical because their growth from cloud, through sky, to the ground is influenced by temperature, humidity, air currents etc. & these conditions are never identical for two snowflakes.

## Tilings

Tillings can have various properties and and various mathematical questions can be derived from them.


???
  

* A tiling is said to be periodic if there exist, among the symmetries of the tiling, at least two translations in non-parallel directions.

.center[<img src="../02_scripts/img/tilings/tilings_18.png" alt="tilings_18" style="width:60%;">[[pi.math.cornell]](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2008-2009/KathrynLindsey/PROJECT/Page2.htm)] 


???
  

* A non-periodic tiling can not simply be constructed based on two translations in non-parallel directions.
* Above, the central star occurs nowhere else in the tiling, and so no translations are possible.
  
* A much more complex question is to ask which shapes can tile a plane in a pattern that does not repeat?

*Penrose rhomb tile*  
.imgref[[[aperiodictiling]](https://www.aperiodictiling.org/wpaperiodictiling/)]]


???
  

* What kind of tiling is this?
* A non-repeating pattern, is call an *aperiodic* tiling. Hence, a set of polygons that tile the plane but never form a periodic tiling.
  
* This means the pattern is not constructable by simple translations of potentially arbitrarily large periodic patches. Shifting an aperiodic tiling cannot produce the same tiling. 
* It is not possible to create the tiling by taking some (potentially very large) section and repeating it over and over again. 
* Around 1973/74 Roger Penrose found a set of two tiles that only tile non periodically.

# Sacred Geometry


???
  

* Speaking of religion, there is a discipline called *sacred geometry*. Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions [1, as cited in [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_geometry)]. It is associated with the belief that god is a mathematician, specializing in geometry, applying this mastery when building the world. Here, the synchronicity of the universe is determined by certain mathematical constants, which express themselves in the form of patterns and cycles in nature. The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has then sometimes been considered sacred.
